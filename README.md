# YM2151 Tutorial

This is a tutorial on how to get started using the YM2151 to make music on the Commander X16.

## Overview of the YM2151 synthesizer

The YM2151 has eight parallel sound channels and each sound channel consists 
of the following:

* A key note selector. This selects the base frequency (pitch) to be played.
* A waveform generator. This selects the timbre of the note.
* An envelope generator. This selects the amplitude modulation of the note.

All three of the above must be configured, in order to get sound out of the
YM2151 chip.

Furthermore, the YM2151 has a dedicated noise generator as well as a vibraro
generator.

In this tutorial each of these parts will be covered, including examples that
show how they are used.
